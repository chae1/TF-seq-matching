## TF-seq-matching
Python script for the following procedures:
* Read Transcription Factor (TF) data files "1_sorted.csv" ~ "20_sorted.csv" and make a TF sequence database.
* Read a promoter sequence "SIRT3_promoter.txt" and find all TF sequences and their positions in the promoter (fast string matching algorithm is used).
* Write matching results to "result.csv".

Modify the data file paths in "seq.py".
